# IA-BOMBERMAN

Welcome to the IA-BOMBERMAN repository! This project is aimed at developing an AI program capable of playing the classic Bomberman game autonomously.

## Overview

The `ia.c` file contains the code for the AI logic implemented in the Bomberman game. This program leverages various algorithms and techniques to navigate the game environment, place bombs strategically, and outsmart opponents.
This code was collaboratively developed for a college course by Arthur, Victor, and myself.

## Features

- Autonomous gameplay: The AI player can navigate the Bomberman map, avoid obstacles, and engage in combat with other players.
- Decision-making: The AI employs sophisticated decision-making algorithms to determine the best actions to take based on the current game state.
- Customizable settings: Parameters such as game difficulty, map size, and opponent behavior can be adjusted to tailor the gaming experience.

## Usage

To run the IA-BOMBERMAN program:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `ia.c` file using your preferred C compiler.
3. Execute the compiled binary to start the AI-powered Bomberman gameplay.

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcome! Whether you want to enhance the AI algorithms, optimize performance, or add new features, feel free to submit pull requests.
